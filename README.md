Simply drag from the bottom-right deck to draw a random card.
Drag the card back on the deck to shuffle it back
Click a drawn card to flip it
Rightclick a drawn card to turn it upsidedown

Above the deck there's a "Choose a card" button, on click it will show a small dialog in the center of the window, asking for a number in input (the index of the card), select an index and press "Confirm".
Will draw nothing if the index doesn't exist or the card is already drawn.
You have to start counting from 0, so the first card (The Fool) would be the card 0, the last card (The World) would be 21.

In the above bar you can regulate:
Card Size, the check allow to keep the ratio with each change, the ratio can change if you uncheck, change values, and check again.
The number of cards in the deck, the app will search in the "Cards" folder for files with name {cardIndex}.jpg, starting with 0. (so 0.jpg, 1.jpg, 2.jpg ecc.)

The topright switch gives you a 50/50 chance for the cards to be upside down when drawn.

* background.jpg is the background of the table
* back.jpg is the back fo the cards
* 0.jpg, 1.jpg ecc are the cards art.
